		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-1_title = AA-1 "Rummer" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-1_description = The Rummer is the first liquid engine ever manufactured at scale. The turbopump which delivers ethanol and oxidizer to the combustion chamber is driven by the decomposition of a small amount of monopropellant. Graphite jet vanes can be used to divert some of the exhaust to achieve a primitive kind of thrust-vectoring.

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-3_title = AA-3 "Charka" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-3_description = Thanks to simplified plumbing, more robust turbomachinery, and a slightly expanded nozzle, the Charka yields both higher thrust and higher specific impulse than its predecessor. Its innovative toroidal tank can hold three times as much monopropellant, allowing the engine to support longer burns and thus more ambitious missions.

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-6_title = AA-6 "Highball" Ethanol Engine 
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-6_description = The Highball is a total redesign of the classic bipropellant engine architecture, featuring a single injector plate and cylindrical chamber, blazing the trail for all future liquid rocket engines. Despite growing interest in more volatile propellants, our engineers have stuck with good old ethanol for this one, just to be on the safe side.

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-6-4_title = AA-6-4 "Old Fashioned" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-6-4_description = In order to compete with the rising popularity of more performant rocket fuels, our marketing team came up with the idea of just bundling a load of existing engines together. These old units are on clearance, four for the price of three!

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-15_title = AA-15 "Shot" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-15_description = Four pressure-fed combustion chambers make up the miniature Shot engine, removing the need for any monopropellant. This little engine that could was originally designed to accelerate experimental aircraft to record-breaking speeds and altitudes.

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-15-2_title = AA-15-2 "Double" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-15-2_description = The self-explanatory Double should satisfy those who consider the Shot to be a little on the weak side, though still gives fairly modest performance. The extra kick does help to propel some more stubborn hypersonic craft to the edge of space, or perhaps beyond.

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-21_title = AA-21 "Flute" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-21_description = The Flute is an advanced ethanol engine derived from the Highball, with increased thrust and specific impulse and even sporting one of those fancy new gimballing combustion chambers. Unlike the Highball, no monopropellant is required to run the engine, since its gas generator uses fuel and oxidizer instead.

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-28_title = AA-28 "Teku" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-28_description = The Teku is a proper modern ethanol engine with an elegant, reliable design â€” a far cry from the bewilderingly complex plumbing of its ancestors. Its very high thrust-to-weight ratio and flawless service record make it especially suited to an emergency launch-escape system, but it's versatile enough for a variety of other applications.

		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-28-v_title = AA-28-V "Chalice" Ethanol Engine
		#LOC_AlcoholicAeronautics_aa-28-v_description = This vacuum-optimised variant of the Teku approaches the limit of specific impulse that can be squeezed out of ethanol without some seriously impressive turbomachinery. The large nozzle extension of the Chalice comes in both a classic ablative model and a sleek carbon-carbon variant.
